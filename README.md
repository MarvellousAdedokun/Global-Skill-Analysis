# 🎯 **Why This Project Exists**

Millions of people want to learn new skills — but most don’t know which skills actually matter in the global market.

This project fixes that.

By analyzing worldwide skill trends across different economic groups, it helps learners, coaches, and policymakers understand:

- Which skills are booming  
- Which countries focus on what  
- Where opportunities are growing fastest  
- And what skills YOU should learn depending on your goals  

This is **career guidance powered by real global data.**


# 🙋‍♂️ **Who This Project Is For**

This project is perfect if you are:

### ✔ A learner deciding which skill to study next  
### ✔ A career changer looking for high-demand skills  
### ✔ A student planning for the future  
### ✔ An educator building training programs  
### ✔ A policymaker studying workforce trends  
### ✔ A data professional curious about global skill patterns  

If you want to align your skills with global opportunity — this is for you.


# ❓ **What You’ll Learn**

This analysis uses World Bank Income Groups to reveal:

### **1. What tech skills are most popular worldwide**  
and how they compare to a specific country (Nigeria).

### **2. How skill focus differs between Low vs. High income economies**  
Traditional industry skills vs. balanced tech/business/soft skills.

### **3. Which income group leads global tech adoption**,  
especially in advanced & disruptive technologies.

If you're trying to decide what to learn next, these insights help you choose skills with real global demand.


# 📊 **Key Insights (Fast + Simple)**
